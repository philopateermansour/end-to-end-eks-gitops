Your '{{ .Chart.Name }}' chart has been deployed.
Release name: {{ .Release.Name }}

### Accessing Your Guestbook Application

Your Ingress is configured to route traffic to your application.

1.  If you have a DNS entry for '{{ .Values.ingress.host }}' that points to your Ingress Controller's IP address, you can access the application at:

    http://{{ .Values.ingress.host }}

2.  If you are testing locally (e.g., on Minikube with the Ingress addon enabled) or don't have DNS set up, you may need to find your Ingress IP and access it directly.

###  IMPORTANT: How to Update Your Passwords

It is recommended to use the `helm upgrade` command with the `--set-string` flag to avoid saving plain-text passwords in your `values.yaml` file.

**Example: How to change the MySQL user password:**

1.  Run the upgrade command with your new password:
    helm upgrade --install {{ .Release.Name }} . --set-string secrets.mysqlUserPassword="YOUR_NEW_STRONG_PASSWORD"

2.  After the upgrade, the Kubernetes Secret will be updated. You must now manually restart your backend and database pods to force them to use the new password.
    kubectl rollout restart deployment {{ .Release.Name }}-backend
    kubectl rollout restart statefulset {{ .Release.Name }}-mysql


**Example: How to change the Redis password:**

1.  Run the upgrade command:
    helm upgrade --install {{ .Release.Name }} . --set-string secrets.redisPassword="YOUR_NEW_REDIS_PASSWORD"

2.  Restart the pods that use the Redis password:
    kubectl rollout restart deployment {{ .Release.Name }}-redis
    kubectl rollout restart deployment {{ .Release.Name }}-backend
